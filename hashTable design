Hash table design:
	Key struct:
		-> name
		-> pointer to address
		
		
	Hash node class <K, V>:
		-> Value
		-> Hash node pointer to next item (chaining resolution)

		Hash node constructor: set Value,
				       next pointer is set to null,
				       a key is created with pointer to address of self
		
	Hash table class <K, V> :
		Hash table constructor: allocates memory of type Hash node, 
					create vector of type K that stores all keys inside,
					
					
		Hash table deconstructor: reallocates memory
